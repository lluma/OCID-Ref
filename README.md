# OCID-Ref: A 3D Robotic Dataset with Embodied Language for Clutter Scene Grounding

![Figure1](./figure1.jpg)

## Introduction
To effectively apply robots in working environments and assist humans, it is essential to develop and evaluate how visual grounding (VG) can affect machine performance on occluded objects. However, current VG works are limited in working environments, such as offices and warehouses, where objects are usually occluded due to space utilization issues. In our work, we propose a novel OCID-Ref dataset featuring an referring expression segmentation task with referring expressions of occluded objects. [OCID-Ref](#dataset) consists of 305,694 referring expressions from 2,300 scenes with providing RGB image and point cloud inputs. To resolve challenging occlusion issues, we argue that it's crucial to take advantage of both 2D and 3D signals to resolve challenging occlusion issues. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of aggregating 2D and 3D signals but referring to occluded objects still remains challenging for the modern visual grounding systems.

## Dataset
#### OCID
First, you must download the fully original RGBD data from [OCID](https://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/vision-for-robotics/software-tools/object-clutter-indoor-dataset/) to your local.

#### OCID-Ref
The cleaned annotations and referring expressions could download from [GDRIVE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dUKpfRiSQD7bWXtpbd9aVzgquYHtWfZv?usp=sharing).

The details of the usage of the annotations. Please follow up the instructions in [instruction.txt](./instruction.txt).
